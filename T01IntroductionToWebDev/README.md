## Lesson 01: Introduction To Web Development
> What is software?

Software is a collection of instructions and data that tell the computer system what to do.
It is created by programmers and installed on the computer device.
Programmers are also known as coders, software developers, software engineers.

> What is a website or web app?

A website or a web app is a computer software installed on a computer server and accessed via the web browser.
A user can access a website or web app from a computer device that has internet.
Accessing websites or web apps is referred to as surfing or browsing.

> What are programming languages?

A software developer creates a software using special language that the computer can translate and understand. They are called programming languages.
Commonly used ones include Python, Java, C# (See Sharp), JavaScript, PHP, Kotlin, C/C++, Ruby, Perl and Visual Basic.

> What is an IDE?

The codes that make up a software are created using another special code editing software referred to as IDE (integrated development environment). IDE helps developers to type, edit, save, debug, run and test their work.
Commonly used IDEs include Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, Android Studio, Eclipse, Atom, NetBeans, Notepad++, IntelliJ IDE, Sublime, PHPStorm, PyCharm, IDLE, etc.

> Installing Visual Studio Code IDE

1. Open browser and visit: **code.visualstudio.com**
2. Download and Install
3. Create a folder on your computer and name it `webdev`.


## Lesson 02: HTML, CSS and JavaScript
> What is web document?

Consider a website or a web app as a digital book or magazine.
It has pages containing text, images, videos, audio, etc.
As programmers, let’s refer to a page on the website or web app as a web document.
A web document is file of codes that make up a web page.

> What is HTML?

To create a web document, we write special codes that the computer system can translate and understand to produce our web page.
The language for doing that is known as HyperText Markup Language (or HTML, for short).

> What is CSS ?

The HTML codes just print raw output in the web browser.
To add decorations and styling to them to look beautiful, we use another special language called Cascading Style Sheet – CSS
A CSS file contains declaratives that add styling in form of shapes, colours, sizes, alignment, shadows, divisions, etc. to an HTML document to enhance the look of the page.

> What is JavaScript?

After painting our HTML codes with CSS, we need to add some automation in the form of flexibility effects and logical controls.
JavaScript is the programming language of the web.
Its adds automation, logic controls and data processing functionalities to our websites and web apps.

>  Creating an HTML document

1. Open the `webdev` folder you created in the previous lesson.
2. Create a folder in that and name it `lesson01`
3. Open the folder in the IDE – Visual Studio Code
4. Create a file and name it `index.hmtl`
5. Type the following in the file:
```
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <title>Personal Blog</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Hello World!</h1>
        <p>My name is Joejo Enchill</p>
    </body>
</html>
```
6. Save the file.
7. Open it with the web browser.
